My first PWA.

This is a site with a simple design and several pages that can be accessed via hyperlinks located on the site. The site can be used as a template for beginner web-programmers, because the page code is very small and simple, thanks to this even beginners who even have a little command of HTML-5, JavaScript and CSS can work with it.

To start working with the Site you need:

1. Basic or superficial knowledge of HTML-5, JavaScript, CSS

2. Access to the terminal (console), stable Internet

3. Application for editing code.

4. Access to the Git library

First you need to download the code, for this open the terminal and enter this command: git clone https://github.com/NagibatorPetia/My-PWA
